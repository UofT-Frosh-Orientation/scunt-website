To hot reload:
First make sure you have all the dependencies. run `npm install` in client and root directories
1. open a terminal in the client folder and type `npm run watch` - this will rebuild your frontend code on save
2. open a separate terminal and type `npm start` in the root directory - this will run the backend server 

This is not the best solution, I think the best solution would be with webpack but building the frontend each time means we're working with optimized & compressed (production-level) code.
